## Contributing :smile:

I'd love to see people using and contributing to this library! To keep it easier for people down the line, you **must** follow these rules about code formatting so that people can have the opportunity to _enjoy_ working with and contributing this library.

#### the rules you **must** follow to get a pull request accepted!

1. Code must be `go fmt`-ed
2. Code must pass `go lint`
3. Code must pass `go vet`
4. Code must be organized in a manner coherent with the rest of the package
5. You must have tests! Pretty comprehensive ones.
6. You must document/comment your code _well_
7. Any `golang` standards not mentioned here apply as well (use of interfaces, etc.)
